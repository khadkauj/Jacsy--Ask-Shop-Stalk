Once you have created this Dockerfile, you can build the image using the following command:
```
docker build -t yourusername/yourappname .
```
Replace yourusername with your Docker Hub username and yourappname with the name you want to give your app.

After the image has been built, you can push it to Docker Hub using the following command:


```
docker push yourusername/yourappname
```
Once the push is complete, your app will be available on Docker Hub and can be pulled and run using the following command:

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 yourusername/yourappname
```

This will run your app on port 5000 on your local machine.
